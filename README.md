# Welcome to my Python Portfolio !
You will find here some examples of my working using Python for data handling, visualization and machine learning. The file refers to the study "The harmful effects of denial". To see the final version of this study, please visit my private homepage: [Tharcisio Leone](https://tharcisio-leone.com/publication/).

If you're using my code, you are welcome to connect with me on LinkedIn and optionally send me feedback to help steer this or other code I have already published: [Tharcisio Leone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tharcisio-leone/).
